This is a copy of the last known working stack-version (1.9.3) binary.
To copy it to the default location use the following command:

sudo cp ./stack-1-9-3 /usr/bin/stack

Newer stack versions (at least for me) always complain about a missing haddock.

Also a binary with version 2.1.3, since newer releases don't include arm-architecture
sudo cp ./stack-2-1-3 /usr/bin/stack
